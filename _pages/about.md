# Tai Dang

I am a researcher working on **Generative Diffusion Models** and **Reinforcement Learning**, with applications in **AI for Science**, particularly computational biology and molecular discovery.

My research focuses on developing principled generative models and reinforcement learning methods for scientific discovery at scale.
